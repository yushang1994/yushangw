## Welcome! ## 

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at the [University at Buffalo, The State University of the New York](https://www.buffalo.edu/) Prior to joining my PhD, I studied in [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) and received my Bachelor's in both Economics and Applied Mathematics.

**I will be on the 2023-2024 Job Market and will be available for interviews.**

My research interests lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Development, Health, Labor and Transportation Infrastructure. My current research focuses on how transportation systems affect development and health outcomes. I have teaching experience in introduction-level economics courses.
