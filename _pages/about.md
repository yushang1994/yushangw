## Welcome! ## 

I am a Lecturer in the [Department of Economics](https://cla.auburn.edu/economics/) at the [Auburn University](https://cla.auburn.edu/)  I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (UB)](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) in 2024. Prior to joining my PhD, I studied in [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) and received my Bachelor's in both Economics and Applied Mathematics.

My research interests lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Health, Transportation, and Public Policy. My current research focuses on how transportation systems affect development and health outcomes. 

I share my home with two cats at very different stages of life. Sam, an 18-year-old Nebelung, is a calm and gentle presence, while Rashba, a 1-year-old British Shorthair, brings curiosity and youthful energy into every day.
