## Welcome! ## 

I am a Lecturer in the [Department of Economics](https://cla.auburn.edu/economics/) at the [Auburn University](https://cla.auburn.edu/)  I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (UB) in 2024. Prior to joining my PhD, I studied in [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) and received my Bachelor's in both Economics and Applied Mathematics.

My research interests lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Health, Transportation, and Public Policy. My current research focuses on how transportation systems affect development and health outcomes.
