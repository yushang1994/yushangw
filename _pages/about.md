## Welcome! ## 

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at the [University at Buffalo, The State University of the New York](https://www.buffalo.edu/) Prior to joining my PhD, I studied in [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) and received my Bachelor's in both Economics and Applied Mathematics.

**I will be on the 2023-2024 Job Market and will be available for interviews.**

My research interests lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Development, Health, Labor and Transportation Infrastructure. My current research focuses on how transportation systems affect development and health outcomes. I have teaching experience in introduction-level economics courses. 

**I will present my job market paper [Can High-speed Rail Improve Middle-aged and Elderly People's Mental Health? Evidence from China](/yushangw/files/pdf/research/JMP_YushangWei.pdf) at the ASSA 2024 Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.** Here is the specific information ([Link](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2024/preliminary/2067?q=eNqrVipOLS7OzM8LqSxIVbKqhnGVrJQMlWp1lBKLi_OTgRwlHaWS1KJcXCArPDUTyElJrAQp0TUFSWTmpkKUlGWmloMMKSooXDAKmBoo1dYCXDDhxh0Q)) of my paper session.
