## I enjoy baking. 

If you ask my neighbors about the best part of living near me, you'll receive a consistent response: the volume of baked goods that comes from my home.

**Below are images of my baking creations!**

## 🎮 Gaming

Recently, I’ve been enjoying playing video games in my free time, especially **Animal Crossing** on the Nintendo Switch. I like its relaxing and creative gameplay. I also enjoy **The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Super Smash Bros**.
