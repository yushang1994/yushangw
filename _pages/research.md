      The paper studies the effect of the high-speed rail (HSR) service on the mental health of individuals aged 45 and older. I use historical documents and ArcGIS Pro to produce the railway map of the late Qing Dynasty (1911) and use it as an instrument for the modern HSR network in China. I find that the HRS service significantly improves the mental health of middle-aged and elderly people, and the causal impact is larger for urban than for rural residents. I also explore and find supporting evidence for three channels of influence: income, access to medical services and in-person interactions. The HRS increases employment opportunities and, hence, individual income, improves the accessibility of medical resources outside the local area, and increases the frequency of in-person visits by children who do not live in the same city as their parents.

      Using a panel of Chinese cities over the period 1999 - 2018, I examine the determinants of economic growth, focusing on the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and road infrastructure. Consistent with the predictions of a human capital-augmented Solow model, I find that FDI has a positive effect on the per capita GDP growth rate and this effect is intensified by the road infrastructure of the city. The latter suggests that one way that road infrastructure contributes to growth is to serve as a facilitator for technology transfers stemming from FDI. The findings suggest the FDI-road infrastructure complementary effect is stronger for technology-intensive FDI than for labor-intensive FDI. The results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation methods.

  - "Do College Graduates Serving as Village Officials Help Local Health level" with Yuting Bai (*Draft coming soon*)

      <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
      <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
      The College Graduate Village Officials (CGVOs) program in China is a unique human capital reallocation policy initiated by the government. This program deploys recent college graduates to rural and underdeveloped areas as village-level officials. CGVOs are engaged in various projects, including governance, economic development, education, and healthcare, with the overarching goal of enhancing the quality of life in China's rural regions while providing career opportunities for college graduates. In this paper, We employ a Difference-in-Difference (DD) approach as my baseline estimation strategy, comparing the impact on local health before and after the introduction of CGVOs.
