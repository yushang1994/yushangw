      The paper studies the effect of the high-speed rail (HSR) service on the mental health of individuals aged 45 and older. I use historical documents and ArcGIS Pro to produce the railway map of the late Qing Dynasty (1911) and use it as an instrument for the modern HSR network in China. I find that the HSR service significantly improves the mental health of middle-aged and elderly people, and the causal impact is larger for urban than for rural residents. I also explore and find supporting evidence for three channels of influence: income, access to medical services and in-person interactions. The HSR increases employment opportunities and, hence, individual income, improves the accessibility of medical resources outside the local area, and increases the frequency of in-person visits by children who do not live in the same city as their parents.

  - Road Infrastructure in China: Assessing the Impact on Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Growth  [![PDF Link](/yushangw/images/research/pdf.jpeg){:height="24px" width="24px"}](/yushangw/files/pdf/research/Topic01_YushangWei.pdf)

      Using a panel of Chinese cities over the period 1999 - 2018, I examine the determinants of economic growth, focusing on the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and road infrastructure. Consistent with the predictions of a human capital-augmented Solow model, I find that FDI has a positive effect on the per capita GDP growth rate and this effect is intensified by the road infrastructure of the city. The latter suggests that one way that road infrastructure contributes to growth is to serve as a facilitator for technology transfers stemming from FDI. The findings suggest the FDI-road infrastructure complementary effect is stronger for technology-intensive FDI than for labor-intensive FDI. The results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation methods.

   - Too Shiny to Handle: The Effect of Light Pollution on Mental Health with [Kaiyi Wen](https://www.kaiyiwen.com/) (Draft available upon request)

      In this paper, we present the first study to establish a causal relationship between light pollution and mental health in the US. We utilize a nationally representative sample at the individual level, coupled with precise measurements of light pollution at the 9-digit zip code level. Our findings demonstrate that 2.7% of respondents who previously reported minimal mental health concerns are now showing mild symptoms of mental health issues. This translates to an annual welfare loss of up to $47 billion attributed to lost earnings in the labor market. Additionally, this study explores specific channels, where we observe a significant negative correlation between light pollution and respondents' sleep duration.
