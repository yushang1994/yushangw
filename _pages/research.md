## Working papers
"Road Infrastructure in China: Assessing the Impact on Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Growth"

> Abstruct: Using a panel of Chinese cities over the period 1999 - 2018, I examine the determinants of economic growth, focusing on the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) and road infrastructure. Consistent with the predictions of a human capital-augmented Solow model, I find that FDI has a positive effect on the per capita GDP growth rate and this effect is intensified by the road infrastructure of the city. The latter suggests that one way that road infrastructure contributes to growth is to serve as a facilitator for technology transfers stemming from FDI. The findings suggest the FDI-road infrastructure complementary effect is stronger for technology-intensive FDI than for labor-intensive FDI. The results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation methods.

"Can High-Speed Rail improve middle-aged and elderly people's mental health? Evidence from China" ï¼ˆJob Market Paper)

> Abstruct:This paper studies the effects of high-speed rail service on the mental health of middle-aged and elderly people aged 45 years or older. However, OLS comparisons between treated and untreated locations are unlikely to consistently estimate the causal effect of the high-speed rail improvement because the selection of locations into the treatment group is non-random. Therefore, I collected and restored the railway map at the end of the Qing dynasty by ArcGIS Pro. Using the unique historical geographic data as the instrument in high-speed rail networks, I found that high-speed rail service could increase the mental score of middle-aged and elderly people by around 1.5 points. The paper also examines the mechanisms through which high-speed rail improves the mental health of middle-aged and elderly people. There are three potential channels of influence: income effect, resource effect, and family effect. In particular, the findings suggest that high-speed rail could increase meeting frequency with their children, which reduces loneliness. However, high-speed rail service also increases the mental health gap between urban and rural areas.
